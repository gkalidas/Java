stack -> ADT -> when we talk about abstract data type, we only talk
about the features provided by the data type and not the implementation

stack features are
Last in first out

push - to add the data at the end of the stack
pop - to remove element from the top
peek - find first element

book - last book
app - bug - lunch
application in windows/linux/android

can go with 
array(static) and linkedList(dyanamic)

top - will store last element
overflow error -> full stack
underflow error -> empty stack

Stack - util
